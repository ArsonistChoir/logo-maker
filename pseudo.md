Make objects of shapes, colors, and empty string for text
Create inquirer test to give 3 options for shapes
Create test for colors (has to work with hexadecimal and keyword)
Have string just be text

This is the hard part

Have image change depending on user input
Have the a string generated with core parts changed depending on user input
I.E. dimensions based on what shape user choose, fill depending on color and text being text

Needs Jest (whats jest?)

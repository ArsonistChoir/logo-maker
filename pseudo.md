Make objects of shapes, colors, and empty string for text
Create inquirer test to give 3 options for shapes
Create test for colors (give them some preset options)
Have string just be text

This is the hard part

Have image change depending on user input
I guess have CSS pull a base image from first choice (triangle, circle, or square)
Then have the CSS change the color of said image depending on choice
Then insert the string in there and have it spaced well
